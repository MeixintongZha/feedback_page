# Double Factorial

The [Double Factorial](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_factorial) is the product of all the odd integers up to a
specified odd positive integer. The mathematical notation is `n!!`.

Because the [Chi Squared](../continuous/chi_squared.html), [Student's t](../continuous/students_t.html), and
[Weibull](../continuous/weibull.html) Distributions require the [Gamma Function](gamma.html), and because this use of
the Gamma Function requires it to be defined for negative odd integers, that case is handled by this recursive
implementation.

### Assumptions

`n` is an odd Integer.

### Use

`mctad.doubleFactorial(n)`

      // described at [the Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_factorial#Negative_arguments).
